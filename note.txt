Things done so far:

1.Home Page -> Completed
2.Sign In / Sign Up -> Completed
3.Dashboard -> Created
4.Except Book Services,chat with AI,chat service Provider,all is done as per the dummy data.

Things to do :

1.Enable dynamic data to render b/w customer and service Provider.
2.Make Book services functionable with full payment gateway,render data on backend and simulatenously show it on my booking page if successfull.
3.Next is Chat option also a sort of web socket use case as a chat ui is expected and talk with users.
4.Last is chat feature with service provider.

Things to resolve:
1. Customer is in DB, service provider is hardcoded (not in DB), is chat possible ?
2.For customer he can see the booking on his Dashboard but for service provider its not there.
3.Should service provider be also in db and given separate Dashboard.
